Дата выхода: Hi Spikes, Now that all the spoilers are out, I’m curious what everyone thinks of Mono Blue going forward, including any new tools and how it shakes up against the other likely top decks of the meta. Some thoughts I have about cards that look like possible new pieces for the deck: Augur of Bolas - Not being able to hit Curious Obsession is a bummer, and I’m not sure what card this replaces in either the main or the side, but given its potency in Pauper (which I know has better cantrips) Скачайте любой из 14 треков Enigmatic Obsession бесплатно в mp3! 1 альбомов исполнителя для скачивания или прослушивания онлайн.  
Hey Spikes, amp#x200B; I wanted to start a series highlighting some of the cards that I feel are overlooked but competitively viable. I've always found satisfaction in finding the unexpected especially early in the format. My UG Devotion was the first deck as far as I can tell/remember to play Collected Company, a card that was written off as mediocre during the early days of its spoiling.

So much has been said so well about the characters' psyche I thought i'd offer something about the plot which seems to be treading towards a point of no redemption. As a big plot person I actually expressed worry in this comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/KillingEve/comments/bjj3le/-/em8p6p3) which imo realized. Instead of piling on, I am going to stretch the heck out of this and try to fix it with my inference and speculation. If you spot any holes below, fire away.

Performance seems okay so far and plays like standard tempo mono blue. Its a tempo deck with no board wipe so if your let your opponent goes wide, its a scoop. A potential 5/5 at turn 3 with card draw is surprisingly nice. Wish Silent Submersible was not double blue, or had evasion, or was not a rare. Any advise on how to make the deck better?

Following an idea sparked by a comment from u/vistarmonei, I decided to put together a list of lesbian related films. A Lesbian Movie Database of sorts, or LMDB, if you will. :) I've listed the films alphabetically and included a link to the IMDB entry for each. I've tried to keep the blurbs spoiler-free. Some of these films have only marginal connections to lesbians, like _Mulholland Drive_, but I felt they should be included. In some cases, the characters could.

I don't remember the exact plot, but mental illness, dreams and romance/obsession seemed to be the main theme. In the end, the main character's love interest/enemy/stalker fell down the stairs outside a house and landed on the sharp tips of the metal railings outside.

Rivalry not only being a theme of the films (in the Prestige its between two magicians and in the Illusionist it’s between an Illusionist and a crazed Crown Prince.) but a reel life rivalry between the films. Here we have that strange occurrence of two movies with similar themes coming out the same year and one completely over shadowing the other. This happened famously with Tombs.

Some backstory : The illustrated Fantastic Beasts book came out, and I was looking at it while talking to a friend. At that point in time, I was really into astronomy, especially the constellations. I don't know where the idea came from, but we discussed the possibility of adapting the beasts into a wizarding version of astrology, more specifically the zodiac.
