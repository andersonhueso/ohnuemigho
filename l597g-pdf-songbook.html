GUITAR TAB TRADER BLOG: http://gu. The internet is a cornucopia of goodness. Thanks to all of the hard working people who have taken the time to compile tablature and keep spreading the music around the globe. Here on Reddit, I've stumbled on a HUGE Jerry Garcia pdf and another HUGE Phish one. I'm looking for some pdf's of Wilco, The Band, Neil Young, Ween, Radiohead, or any Folk Tunes/Americana/Country/Bluegrass. Chords and Lyrics would suffice. Can anyone here point me in the right direction? Cheers Edit: Removed. Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me. I'm basically looking for full pdf songbooks for piano (Not just the vocal melody or guitar tabs) for the following albums. However, if anyone has pdfs of any individual songs from any of these albums, that would be much appreciated too. ~~Bruce Springsteen - Greatest Hits (Ideally Hungry Heart, Thunder Road)~~; ~~The Beach Boys - Best of/Pet Sounds~~; ~~Talking Heads - This must be the Place~~; ~~Peter Gabriel~~; ~~REM - In Time~~;. I'm mostly an acoustic player and I like to play songs that I can sing along with. I've been playing for a long time, but I've never figured out the best way to keep a songbook. 10 years ago, I had a binder with some songs, but I didn't keep up with it and I'm wondering if there are any better ways to do it with technology (or if the old notebook/binder is still the best way to go). The second part of this question is about the format of a songbook. Is it easiest to just copy-paste the lyrics. Hi all, I've been working on a songbook generator program, basically a ChordPro (https://www.chordpro.org/) reimplementation (because I was pretty unhappy with the reference ChordPro perl implementation). I am running into problems and questions as to how to render the result. My design goals: - Have the result templated. In contrast to ChordPro's approach which is to render PDFs programatically, this offers greater flexibility and greatly simplifies configuration - Preferably provide After seeing the other massive sheet music PDF database posted, I thought I'd share this one I stumbled on that is absolutely massive. It is somewhat hard to navigate and in Cyrillic, but I've come across some pretty cool stuff. Here you go ( Some of my favorite finds include Radiohead (Karma Police) X Japan, Harry Potter songbooks, Bill Evans transcriptions, and The Who's Tommy. Definitely a lot of strange, Russian (?) pop to wade through I've been playing the piano quite a bit lately, I've actually made a post here before asking about where to start, and I think I'm getting better- If you guys can help me find the notes/phrases for those three songs i'll record myself playing or something. thank. 
I have all the books except American Idiot and I can't find a good quality. I've been looking for any except Greatest Hits, One Hot Minute, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication and By The Way cheers. I have all the pdfs except in through the out door and the the complete studio albums has ITTOD's tracks. cheers. Can't find any online would appreciate cheers. I'm looking for someone who can record themselves playing a song for me. I'd like to use the recording as my accompaniment to sing a special musical number at my church. I can email the sheet music to you. I need someone who can do this free or very cheap. I need the recording ASAP. Can someone here help me? ETA: Link to sheet music: The song can be listened to online here: Thank. I just got an electronic ocarina of time from my lovely girlfriend for Christmas. It seems extremely cool, the one problem I have is the songbook that it is supposed to come with it seems to be missing. I would just return it for a new one but we don’t seem to have a receipt. I was hoping someone else here might have a copy of this song/instruction book and might be able to send me a pdf or pictures of it? Thanks. I've been working on something for a while for myself and I thought maybe others could try it out. It's a song book for iPad (it's a PDF so it works on pretty much anything with a screen) with simplified chords for songs. You have to know the melody, tempo, and know generally how the song goes, but it's still pretty handy. I wrote it for myself so there might be some quirks only I understand. The song selection covers a ton of styles, it can get pretty kitschy, but it's based on what people. More files available for downloading will be added here soon.

Songbook is an acoustic live album by American musician and Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell, released on November 21, 2011. The live album features songs recorded.
